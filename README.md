# StudySync-Hackout
## Problem Statement:
As students we have experienced and we believe nowadays most of the students face the problem of **Time-Management** as well as **Focus**.So we have come up with the following solution.
## Plausible Solution:
**StudySync** lives up to its name by enabling you to monitor your study timetable.
It's a web application platform designed to make a student's life better by organizing and managing it.
Additionally, because there are no outside distractions from other websites, studying becomes more focused.
## Key Features
- Ability to make a list of every YouTube playlist that a student wants to watch or finish studying later on.
- A pie chart is also used to show the progress a person has made toward reaching his objective.Not only can you monitor the playlist's overall progress, but you can also log each playlist's progress separately.
- Because they feel embarrassed about it, students typically find it difficult to ask specific questions at times.We have also included generative AI for doubt-solving while watching the videoÂ in order to address this issue.
